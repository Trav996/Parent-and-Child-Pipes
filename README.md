# Parent-and-Child-Pipes
Write a C program that does the following. Parent sends “Hello, there”, child responds with “Hi, I’m child”. 
Then the parent sends “Are you available now?” and the child responds with “Yes, I’m”. Make appropriate usage of pipes. 
Run the program a few times and observe the sequence of the output statements and predict the order of the scheduling 
of parent and child processes in each run.
